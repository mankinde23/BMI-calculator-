# BMI-calculator-

This project is a kind of tool that is used to estimate whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height . It is calculated by dividing their weight in kilograms by the square of their height(as it is performed in the javascript code ) in meters.This calculation is done to indicate whether a person is underweight,normalweight,overweight or obese.It should aslo be noted that the BMI calculation does not account for factors such as muscle mass ,bone density and body composition.This also means a body with high BMI does not necessarily have excess body fat and a person with a low BMI does not necessarily have a healthy body weight.
